| [Analysis of business indicators](https://github.com/Fandooor/My_education_projects/blob/main/Analysis%20of%20business%20indicators.ipynb) | As a marketing analyst for app, your task is to investigate why the company has been experiencing losses despite significant advertising investments. You will analyze data on user behavior, purchases, and advertising costs from May to October 2019. The project involves identifying where users come from, which devices they use, and the costs associated with acquiring them through various channels. Additionally, you'll assess metrics such as LTV, ROI, retention, and conversion rates to determine the profitability of marketing efforts and provide recommendations to improve customer acquisition strategies.   |
| [Data visualization](https://github.com/Fandooor/My_education_projects/blob/main/Data%20visualization.ipynb)| The project involves a market analysis of public food establishments in Moscow. The investors from the "Shut Up and Take My Money" fund plan to open a new establishment but are unsure of its type (e.g., caf√©, restaurant, pizzeria, pub, or bar), location, menu, or pricing. As a data analyst, you are tasked with preparing a comprehensive report on the Moscow food market. Using a dataset of food establishments from services like Yandex Maps and Yandex Business, you'll conduct data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization. The goal is to present findings to help investors make informed decisions, with a special focus on opening a coffee shop in Moscow.  |
| [Statistical research](https://github.com/Fandooor/My_education_projects/blob/main/Statistical%20research.ipynb)| This project focuses on the analysis of hypotheses and an A/B test for an online store aimed at increasing revenue. In the first part, the task is to prioritize nine hypotheses using the ICE and RICE frameworks, comparing the differences in prioritization between the two methods. In the second part, you will analyze the results of an A/B test using provided datasets, exploring cumulative revenue, average order value, and customer behavior across test groups. The project involves detecting anomalies, calculating statistical significance, and making data-driven decisions on whether to stop the test or continue based on the findings. |
